# WooCommerce Product Bundles - Min/Max Items

### What's This?

Free mini-extension for [WooCommerce Product Bundles](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-bundles/?aff=46147&cid=5699243) that allows you to control the minimum or maximum quantity of bundled products that customers must choose in order to purchase a Product Bundle.

### How It Works

Out of the box, [WooCommerce Product Bundles](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-bundles/?aff=46147&cid=5699243) does not include any options for selling fixed- or variable-size bundles, such as cases of wine, six-packs of soap, or candy boxes.

The plugin adds two new options under **Product Data > Bundled Products**:

* **Items required (≥)**; and
* **Items allowed (≤)**.

With these options, you can define a lower or upper quantity of items that customers must choose to purchase their own custom bundle.

For details, check out [this example](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/bundles/bundles-use-case-pick-and-mix/) from the official WooCommerce Product Bundles documentation.

### Notes

Before installing this plugin, please ensure that you are running the latest versions of both **WooCommerce** and **WooCommerce Product Bundles**.
